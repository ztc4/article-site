## CHALLENGERS

Test driven development was an issue, I wrote all my test but ended up rewriting them since I wanted to do things like change my data for better synchronization with my database schema. I would say I failed planning out how my data was gonna work with my frontend. I also had many issues sizing the image, but later I was able to format them better. There were also many challenges with the deployment on the backend, I had trouble getting the aws lambda server to send images to the frontend, the data kept getting corrupted and that is something I still can't figure out the errors for!

## DeployMENT
